## Widgets

In Flutter everything that appears on the screen is called "widget" because, technically speaking,
itâ€™s a descendant of the Widget class. When you create user interfaces in Flutter you make a
composition of widgets by nesting them one inside the other.

When you nest widgets one inside the other you create a hierarchy called "widget tree" in which
there are parents and children.
