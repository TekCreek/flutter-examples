# 1.1 - Additional lab 

a) Write a search function to search for an element in the given list of integers. This
functon should accept the comparison function as one of the argument and use it to 
perform the comparison. This search function returns true if the element is found 
otherwise false. Demonstrate the usage of this function using sample data.
Note: Do not use sort library function.

b) Write a sort function to sort the list of integers using any sorting technique, 
this function should accept comparator function passed as argument and use it for comparison
logic. Demonstrate the usage of the sort function through sample data. 
Note: Do not use sort library function.
